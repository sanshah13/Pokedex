	A Pokédex is a utility used by people who play the video game Pokémon. It functions as an encyclopedia, containing detailed entries of each Pokémon, including information on its physical abilities, evolution paths, abilities and moves available in battle. A fully detailed Pokédex would contain information on over 700 Pokémon, but ours will focus on a small, proof of concept, subset.


	Our Pokédex contains two separate modes, Dex (short for Pokédex) Mode and Team Mode. The Pokédex loads up in Dex mode, providing a list of our subset of Pokémon. Each Pokémon is assigned a number based on the lore of the Pokémon world, and Pokémon are initially sorted into their numerical order. At the top of the screen is the “List By” feature, which gives you the option to resort the list based on a Pokémon’s name, type, or number.  Types are not displayed on the Dex screen, so knowledge of Pokémon would be required to utilize that listing to the fullest. 


	Now, when a Pokémon is selected it brings you to the Dex Entry. The Dex Entry displays a collection of information, including some general information about the Pokémon, its type, physical stats, and evolutionary chain which each Pokémon goes through on its journey to adulthood. Some Pokémon have pre-evolutionary forms that were discovered later on in the lore and thus have non-sequential numbering; for example, #025 Pikachu has a pre-evolutionary form Pichu who is #172.


	You will notice the “View All Moves” button at the base of the screen, which leads you to a list of the moves a Pokémon can naturally learn as it levels up through the games. They are ordered sequentially, where moves learned first appear first. 


	The second mode of the Pokédex is Team Mode which is accessible from the initial Dex screen. When there are no teams present, you will be asked to create a team. If you don’t you will remain on the screen, where you can either add a team or return to the Dex Mode. Adding a team prompts you for a team name and description. Once a team is added you are instantly brought to the Team Activity Screen. Here you can view information about your team, including the Pokémon currently in your team, and your team’s advantages and disadvantages. The word Advantages is scrollable, so if your screen is small, you will need to scroll that section up and down to view advantages and disadvantages. If there are no Pokémon in your team, you will be prompted to add one. 

    	Select a Pokémon, then select between 1 and 4 moves, an ability on the next screen, and lastly a Nickname. If more than 4 moves are selected, the first four on the list of selected moves will be added. Nicknames are optional, but bring more personalization to each Pokémon. Now you will be brought to a screen that resembles the Dex screen, but displays some more specialized information. Moves is a scrollable list so if your screen is small you will need to scroll for the remaining information. Here you have the option to change the nickname of your Pokémon. Multiple Pokémon can share nicknames. You also have the option to remove this Pokémon from your team. 
       
    	Return to the team screen will update your advantages and disadvantages. Teams are write through, so any change to a team is instantly recorded to memory through (SD card is required for serialization).
